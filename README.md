## Troubleshoot

### I wrote my wallet address and it now displays different

The application works by default with the new cashaddr format. If you supplied an address with the old format, the system will convert it to the new cashaddr format (bitcoincash:...).

### Why is the payment address in the QR/Instructions different than the one in my account?

We create an intermediate address for the payer to send the funds to. Once the funds are confirmed in this address, the funds are then sent to your address.

### What happens if my customer accidentally sends more than the amount?

The overpaid amount is returned to the source address and network fees are shared.
